# Contributing to shush

Thanks for taking the time to help. Bug reports, ideas, docs fixes and code are all welcome.

## Before you start

- **Bugs:** open an [issue](https://github.com/celaldrg/shush/issues/new/choose) with steps to reproduce.
- **Bigger changes:** open an issue first so we can agree on the approach before you spend time on it.
- **First contribution?** Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/celaldrg/shush/labels/good%20first%20issue).

## Development setup

You need Node.js 20 or newer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/celaldrg/shush
cd shush
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
npm run bench   # token savings on the sample fixtures
```
